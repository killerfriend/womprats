\section{Overview}

The T-16 Audio Synthesizer is designed to generate an audio output based on multiple channel inputs, as well as tuneable parameters that are controllable from the user interface.  The functionality can be broken down into several independent sub-modules.  These include a microcontroller to synthesize the audio signal, as well as act as a central communications hub for the other sub-modules, a regulated power supply, an EEPROM memory to dynamically store and load pre-defined user settings and miscellaneous data, an LCD to present the user interface, a DAC to convert the synthesizer's digital audio samples into an analog audio output, and an audio amplifier to provide more output power to an internal speaker and offer a master volume control.

This document outlines the test approach for the T-16 amplifier. It is
broken down into unit tests, as well as integration and acceptance
tests.

The purpose of the audio amplifier is to provide an amplified audio signal to the internal speakers or a line-out to an external audio device.  It receives a 0-3.3 VDC signal and has an external volume control to adjust the output volume.  If the line-out is being used, the internal speaker will turn off.

\section{Acceptance Tests}
The primary goal of the T-16 audio amplifier is to demonstrate the
engineering skills of its team members in an interview
situation. Several acceptance tests have been outlined below:

\subsection{Temperature Test}
The completed T-16 Synthesizer must not rise above $10^\circ$ Celsius
while the internal amplifier is in use.
\subsection{Untrained User}
A completely untrained user must be able to make cool sounds with the
T-16 Synthesizer within 5 minutes of picking up the device for the
first time.
