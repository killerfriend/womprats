# Overview

This DAC is the one we will be using for the practicum
project. Specifically, we will be using the MCP4921 variation.

# How it was chosen

This is the cheapest DAC that has one output, that can use a 3v3
supply, is SPI driven, has an output refresh rate > 44kHz, and is available in both DIP and SOIC packages. 

Additionally, it has a proven track record in open source designs, such as the Adafruit Wave Shield.
